# Neural-Network-Based-End-To-End-Communication-System

This repository presents a novel neural network-based end-to-end communication system, where a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to model the channel effects. The system jointly optimizes the modulation scheme and channel coding used by transmitter and receiver upon their training.
